Changed all <div> to semantic tags

Changed any corresponding css classes with div names to new semantic names

Added alt elements to any pictures and icons to assist in accessability 

Tried to group the css elements in the aside section due to repetitive code however it was making the column excessively long and I was running out of time.


The new code should reflect the following criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
